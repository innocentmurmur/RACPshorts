# RACPshorts
Short case game for the RACP clinicals
Using TWINE 2.3.8 with Harlowe.

Feel free to edit, or download and change it - Would very much welcome additional cases.

Clinical exam cases with timer for cardiology (old version - signs at random), resp, rheum (instructions only so far), neurology, abdo, endocrine.
The idea is to practice on a mannequin, check back to see what you find at each step, and then summarise at the end.
Standard questions (will become) available at the end.

Stuff based on memory, Clinical Medicine for the MRCP PACES, Talley and O'Connor.
